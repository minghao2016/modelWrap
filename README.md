# modelWrap
wrapper for automatized homology modeling of multiple number of sequences on one template structure using "modeller_9.x"
## Important
- the script only works with a template given, therefore only the structural alignment and the model building are implemented.
- no model evaluation is implemented!
## Workflow
- Given `.fasta` file (including all sequences to process) is seperated in single files
- `.fasta` files are converted into the structural file format `.ali`
- `align2d.py` files are generated for each sequence
- `align2d.py` files are processed by modeller -> alignment files are written
- `automodel.py` files are generated for each sequence
- homology models are generated by modeller
- everything is cleaned up and `.pdb` files are stored in the directory
# Requirements
- [modeller_9.x](https://salilab.org/modeller/download_installation.html)
- python3 *(modeller is also executable without installed python3, however this has to be changed in the script (python3 <-> mod9.x))*
# Installation
Bash script, just make it executable and run
## SourceCode compiling with Argbash - argument parser generator
template file can be changed and converted to executable code (tested with argbash_2.8.1; Ubuntu_16.04)

`argbash modelWrap_template -o modelWrap`
